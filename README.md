# imgui-sfml-selectiondemo
A demo that I made for selecting and manipulating shapes with an imgui control panel.

## Vcpkg
Look up vcpkg and run the two commands that it needs.
Will have to make a build dir first.

## This is just a demo
I am not crazy about setting up a huge git page for now because it is just a demo.
